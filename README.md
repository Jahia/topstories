topstories
==========

This module adds a feature to the standard edition engines so that with a single click, content 
authors/publishers/editors can drag n drop a "top stories" block anywhere on a Jahia page. 
 
The module supports by default three hierarchical levels among which publishers can choose from, and 
can easily be simplified if the top stories do not need to be graphically highlighted or prioritized.
